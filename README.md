# ProjectEuler
It is nearly 4 years ago that I started woking on Problems from Project Euler.
As a proof I uploaded all my java code to github back then.
Sinds then I have tried many diferent languages and approaches.
The problems can be found here:  https://projecteuler.net/archives <br/>

All programs without _Name are not solved jet. They are just there to share them between the different distro's I use.
